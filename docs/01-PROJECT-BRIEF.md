# Project Brief: house-mgmt

## Project Overview
**What are we building?**
A household management web application that allows family members to track important recurring tasks, to esnure completion and to address possible duplication.  This also allows for sahring significant information across members such as which meal are arriving for our meal plan, guest information and activities.

**Why are we building it?**
Current solutions are not specific to the SeeWatersEdge household, having both the individual recurring items and general household information in one place

**Who is it for?**
A single household with two people, three pets and occasional guest.

## Success Metrics
- [ ] User can create and manage tasks in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Household members can see real-time updates on a tablet, with a focus on whats been done and what hasnt
- [ ] Basic inforamtion is available within one click
- [ ] App loads and responds within 2 seconds on average

## Core Value Proposition 
Allows for tracking where teh activity occurs, useful information available where users need it

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope (MVP)
- Create, edit, delete family members, recurring tasks, guest, guest activities
- Single point of inforamtion about upcoming meals with recipes
- click based updates to activity completion
- Simple identification of overdue tasks
- Mobile-responsive design

### Out of Scope (Future Versions)
- Interactive guest information
- Metrics on completion trends and targets
- x
- x

### Technical Constraints
- Must work on tablets, multiple vendors
- Deployment on AWS within $20/month budget
- Must be extensible to future information and activities
- Data must be stored in US region for compliance

## Key Assumptions
- Users are comfortable with web-based applications
- Tablets have reliable internet connectivity
- Usage will be by a single household initially, with expansion to multiple houselhold an option
- Users prefer simple touch-based interfaces over feature-rich ones

## Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| Real-time updates cause performance issues | High | Medium | Implement WebSocket connection pooling and rate limiting |
| Users find interface too simple | Medium | Low | User testing before launch, feedback collection |
| AWS costs exceed budget | High | Low | Monitor usage, implement auto-scaling limits |
