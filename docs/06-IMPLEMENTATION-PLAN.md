- **Tablet Browser Compatibility**: Test on actual Fire 10 device early
- **Network Reliability**: Implement robust offline handling

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP feature list, no additions during development
- **Integration Issues**: Daily integration testing and early deployment
- **AWS Configuration**: Use infrastructure as code for reproducibility
- **Performance Issues**: Early performance testing on target hardware

### Mitigation Strategies
- Daily stand-ups with yourself to track progress
- Feature flags for easy rollback of problematic features
- Automated testing pipeline to catch regressions
- Regular deployment to dev environment to catch issues early
