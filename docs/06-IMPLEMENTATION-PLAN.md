## **Key Changes Made to Original Plan:**

1. **✅ Accelerated Database Integration**: We completed real DynamoDB integration on Day 3 instead of using in-memory storage
2. **✅ Added Security Enhancements**: Input validation, sanitization, and production hardening completed early
3. **✅ Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and fallback mechanisms implemented
4. **⏭️ Moved Daily Task Implementation**: Shifted from Day 2 framework to Day 4 full implementation
5. **⏭️ Deferred Weather Integration**: Moved from Day 3 to Day 4 afternoon
6. **⏭️ Delayed Frontend Start**: Pushed Vue.js development to Day 5 to complete backend properly

**Total Timeline Impact**: Still on track for 2-week MVP with more robust backend foundation

**Current Status**: 67/67 tests passing, ready for Day 4 backend completion

## Technical Stack Configuration

- **Python**: 3.13 for Lambda functions
- **AWS CLI**: Latest version with configured profiles
- **AWS SAM CLI**: For local testing and deployment
- **IDE**: VS Code with Vue.js and Python extensions

### AWS Services Configuration
- **API Gateway**: Regional endpoint with IP allowlisting
- **Lambda**: Python 3.13 runtime, 512MB memory
- **DynamoDB**: Pay-per-request billing, encryption enabled
- **S3**: Weather data bucket with encryption
- **EventBridge**: Scheduled triggers for background tasks
- **CloudWatch**: Structured logging and basic metrics
- **Secrets Manager**: OpenWeather API key storage
- **Amplify**: Frontend hosting and CI/CD

### Testing Framework
- **Backend**: pytest with moto for AWS mocking
- **Frontend**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for e2e
- **API**: FastAPI TestClient for integration tests
- **Mocking**: Mock AWS services and external APIs

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AWS Service Limits**: Monitor usage and request increases if needed
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff and caching
- **Tablet Browser Compatibility**: Test on actual Fire 10 device early
- **Network Reliability**: Implement robust offline handling

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP feature list, no additions during development
- **Integration Issues**: Daily integration testing and early deployment
- **AWS Configuration**: Use infrastructure as code for reproducibility
- **Performance Issues**: Early performance testing on target hardware

### Mitigation Strategies
- Daily stand-ups with yourself to track progress
- Feature flags for easy rollback of problematic features
- Automated testing pipeline to catch regressions
- Regular deployment to dev environment to catch issues early
